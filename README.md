Introduction
ViralMSA is a tool for performing multiple sequence alignment (MSA) specifically designed for viral genome sequences. This tool aids in the alignment of genome sequences, which is essential for various evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses. In this example, we will use ViralMSA to align genome sequences and then calculate pairwise distances using tn93.

Usage
Running ViralMSA
To produce a multiple sequence alignment of the genome sequences, follow these steps:

Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Navigate to the 'example' directory in the repository.

Install ViralMSA from its GitHub repository and ensure it's in your system's PATH.

Run the following command, replacing the placeholders with your specific information:

bash
Copy code
ViralMSA.py
INPUT_SEQUENCES.FAS: The FASTA file containing your genome sequences.
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: The directory where the output files will be saved.
HIV-1: The reference name for your sequences.
Running tn93
After obtaining the multiple sequence alignment (in the output directory), you can calculate all pairwise distances using tn93:

Install tn93 by following the instructions on its GitHub repository.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
tn93 -t 1 -l 1 INPUT_ALIGNMENT.ALN > OUTPUT_DISTANCES.CSV
INPUT_ALIGNMENT.ALN: The multiple sequence alignment file generated by ViralMSA.
OUTPUT_DISTANCES.CSV: The file where pairwise distances will be saved in CSV format.
Output
After running the above commands, you will have the following output files:

OUTPUT_ALIGNMENT.ALN: This file contains the multiple sequence alignment of the genome sequences generated by ViralMSA.

OUTPUT_DISTANCES.CSV: This file contains all pairwise distances calculated using tn93 in CSV format.
